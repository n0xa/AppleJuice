# AppleJuice Stick C Plus
M5 StickC-Plus implementation of the AppleJuice Prank by [Noah Axon](https://github.com/n0xa) 

The ESP32 Arduino version would run on this device, but without any LED or display feedback, it was hard to tell if the device was on or off. While adding the LED flashing during advertising, I decided to create an entire UI for this device to take advantage of the display and buttons.

## Features
* BLE Logic based on the ESP32 version
* Menu with button selection UI added
* LED flashes faintly while advertising
